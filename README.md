## 📌 Java Learning Journey Recap (Day 1 - Day 9)

### ✅ Day 1: Introduction to Java & Setup

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ What is Java? Why is it popular?
- ✔️ Java’s history, features, and applications.
- ✔️ Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).
- ✔️ Setting up an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse).
- ✔️ Writing & running the "Hello, World!" program.

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Java is platform-independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
- Java is object-oriented, secure, and widely used.
- Setting up Java correctly is important for smooth development.

---

### ✅ Day 2: Java Basics & Syntax

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Java Program Structure (Classes, Methods, main method).
- ✔️ Java syntax rules (comments, identifiers, keywords).
- ✔️ Data types (primitive: int, double, char, boolean, etc.).
- ✔️ Variables & Constants (final).
- ✔️ Printing output (System.out.println() & printf()).
- ✔️ Taking user input using Scanner.

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Every Java program starts with a class and a main method.
- Java has strict data types (unlike Python & JavaScript).
- User input is handled using Scanner.

---

### ✅ Day 3: Operators & Control Flow

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, Assignment.
- ✔️ If-Else Statements (Decision Making).
- ✔️ Switch-Case (Alternative to multiple if-else).
- ✔️ Loops (for, while, do-while).

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Operators help perform calculations & comparisons.
- if-else is used for decision making.
- for, while, do-while help in repetitive tasks.

---

### ✅ Day 4: Arrays & Strings

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Arrays: Declaration, initialization, and manipulation.
- ✔️ Multi-dimensional Arrays (2D Arrays).
- ✔️ String Handling: Creating and manipulating Strings.
- ✔️ String Methods: `.length()`, `.charAt()`, `.substring()`, `.toUpperCase()`, etc.

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Arrays store multiple values of the same type.
- Strings are immutable in Java.
- The `StringBuilder` class is used for modifying strings efficiently.

---

### ✅ Day 5: Methods & Functions

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Defining & Calling Methods.
- ✔️ Method Parameters & Return Types.
- ✔️ Method Overloading (Multiple methods with same name but different parameters).
- ✔️ Recursion (Methods calling themselves).

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Methods help organize code & avoid repetition.
- Overloading allows multiple versions of a method.
- Recursion is useful for problems like factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

---

### ✅ Day 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 1

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Classes & Objects – Blueprint & real-world objects.
- ✔️ Constructors – Special methods to initialize objects.
- ✔️ Instance Variables & Methods – Attributes & behaviors of objects.
- ✔️ Access Modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `default`).

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Everything in Java revolves around objects.
- Constructors initialize objects automatically.
- Encapsulation hides data using `private` and allows controlled access.

---

### ✅ Day 7: OOP - Part 2 (Inheritance & Polymorphism)

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Inheritance (Extending classes using `extends`).
- ✔️ Super & Subclasses (Parent-child relationships).
- ✔️ Method Overriding (Redefining parent methods in a subclass).
- ✔️ Polymorphism (One interface, many implementations).

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Inheritance allows reuse of existing class functionality.
- Method overriding enables dynamic behavior in subclasses.
- Polymorphism makes code more flexible & scalable.

---

### ✅ Day 8: Abstraction & Interfaces

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Abstract Classes (Classes that can’t be instantiated).
- ✔️ Interfaces (Defining behavior without implementation).
- ✔️ Difference between Abstract Classes & Interfaces.

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Abstract classes contain partially implemented methods.
- Interfaces are like "blueprints" for classes.
- Java allows multiple interfaces but not multiple inheritance.

---

### ✅ Day 9: Exception Handling & File Handling

#### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- ✔️ Try-Catch Blocks (Handling runtime errors).
- ✔️ Throwing & Creating Custom Exceptions.
- ✔️ File Handling – Writing & Reading files using `FileWriter` & `Scanner`.

#### 🔹 Key Takeaways:
- Exceptions prevent program crashes.
- The `try-catch` block handles errors gracefully.
- File handling is useful for saving & reading data.
